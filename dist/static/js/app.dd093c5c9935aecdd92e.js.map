고보장으로 가입되어 있고 가족이 운전할 수 있도록 하였기에 아무 걱정없이\n          차를 빌려주었다. 그런데 그 다음날 경찰서로부터 연락이 왔다. 아들이 사고를 냈는데 사람이 크게 다쳤다는 것이다. 이후 사고처리를 위해 보험사와 경찰서를 드나들던 중 알게 된 사실은 피해자 보상을\n          위한 보험처리가 안된다는 것이었다.\n          보험사의 사고처리직원은 아들이 운전할 수 없는 연령으로 보험이 가입되어 있어 처리가 제한된다고 하며, 경찰관은 가입한 보험으로 처리가 불가하므로 피해자와 합의하지 않으면 형사처벌을 받을 수 있다고\n          한다. 피해자 측에서는 치료비와 넉넉한 합의금을 주지 않으면 민사소송까지 불사하겠다고 강수를 두고 있다. 비싼 보험료를 내고 고보장의 자동차보험에 가입하였음에도 왜 이런 상황까지 오게 된 것일까?\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          자동차보험에는 이런저런 사고의 경우 보상을 하지 않는다는 강력한 면책조항이 있다. 대표적인 5가지 면책조항은 '고의로 사고를 일으킨 경우, 영업행위(유상운송)를 했을 때, 시험용 또는 경기용으로\n          운행했을

        혹독한 비난을 받아야 마땅한 행위이지만, 피해자의 구호를 우선하는 자동차보험은 음주/무면허사고라 할지라도 일정수준의 자기부담금을 지불하면 보상을 해준다.\n        </p>\n        <div class=\"left-border\">\n          음주운전, 무면허운전, 운전자한정위반의 보상여부 비교\n

<blog-article title=\"02. 보상방식의 차이, 자동차상해는 실제손해액 기준으로 더 많이 보상을 해준다?\">\n        <div class=\"margin-bottom\">\n          두 담보간 보상방식의 차이는 사고의 유형과 내가 입은 손해의 종류에 따라 다르기 때문에 아래의 비교 표를 기초로 설명하고자 한다.<br><br>\n          자동차상해와 비교했을 때 자기신체사고의 가장 큰 차이는 내가 부상 또는 후유장애의 피해를 당한 경우에 나타난다. 일례로 12급에 해당하는 부상을 입고 3개월간 치료비로 500만원을 썼다면, 자동차상해 가입자는 자신이 가입한 부상 가입금액의 한도 내에서 모든 비용(치료비, 위자료, 간병비 등)을 보험금으로 지급 받지만, 자기신체사고 가입자는 12급 부상의 보험금 지급한도인 80만원 한도 내에서만 보상을 받게 된다(쌍방과실 기준).<br><br>\n          참고로 상해/후유장애 급수는 자동차손해배상보장법 시행령에서 정한 바 대로 책정되기 때문에 모든 보험사가 동일하며, 급수별 보상한도는 각 보험사의 약관에서 각기 다르게 정의한 ‘상해/후유장애 구분 및 급별 보험가입금액표’에 따른다. <br><br>\n          이를 보상한도 작동방식의 차이라 할 수 있다. 쉽게 말해 자기신체사고는 내가 입은 상해의 심각한 정도에 따라 가입금액 내 보상한도가 변경 적용된다. 하지만 자동차상해는 내가 가입한 보험가입금액 전체를 한도로 보상을 해준다. <br><br>\n          마지막으로 아래 표에서 눈에 띄게 차이가 나는 부분은 나의 100% 과실로 단독사고를 일으킨 경우다. 내가 사망하거나 장애를 입은 경우는 손해액을 산정하지 않고 정해진 가입금액(정액)을 지급한다. 그리고 부상 시에는 치료비, 위자료, 휴업손해 등 실제손해액이 아닌 치료비만을 한도 내에서 보상한다. 자동차보험을 대표하는 6대 담보 중 가입금액 정액을 지급하는 담보는 자기신체사고가 유일하다.
